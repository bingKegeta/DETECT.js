    <p class="mb-4 text-left"><strong>1. What is DETECT?</strong><br>
        DETECT (<strong>Deception Tracking Through Eye Cues Technology</strong>) is an AI-driven system that analyzes <strong>eye movements, gaze patterns, and pupil dilation</strong> to assess behavioral patterns associated with deception.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-left"><strong>2. How does DETECT work?</strong><br>
        DETECT tracks <strong>fixation points, pupil dilation, gaze shifts, and eye movement anomalies</strong> using <strong>machine learning algorithms</strong>. It processes data in real-time or from recorded sessions to identify deviations linked to potential deception.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-left"><strong>3. What equipment is required to use DETECT?</strong><br>
        DETECT is compatible with <strong>standard webcams</strong>, but higher accuracy can be achieved using <strong>dedicated eye-tracking hardware or infrared cameras</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-left"><strong>4. Can DETECT be used in real-time?</strong><br>
        Yes, DETECT processes <strong>live eye movement data</strong>, providing <strong>instant feedback and real-time analysis</strong>. It also supports <strong>post-event evaluation</strong> for recorded sessions.
